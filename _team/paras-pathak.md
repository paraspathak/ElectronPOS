Paras is a full stack software enginner with entrepreneurship aspirations. He started Electron POS while he was a senior at the University of Texas at Arlington and in a few months has managed to grow his customer base from none to over 20 customers all across Dallas FortWorth before the COVID-19 pandemic hit and stopped his business ambitions. 

He is currently pausing further work in his startup before the completion of his Bachelors degree from UT Arlington.
